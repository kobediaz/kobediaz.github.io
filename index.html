			<h3>STRENGTHS</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="s-text">
			<p>I believe that my strengths are when I am determine to do something I wanna see it to the end I will never stop until I have achieved it. Sometimes I even challenge myself if I can do something different or unique when I am drawing.</p>
			<p>The same thing applies when I am occassionaly coding in Unity or when I am doing something on Blender I often ask myself if I can do this and that and experiment on something that I think might come up great.</p>

		<div class="w-head">
			<h3>WEAKNESSES</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="w-text">
			<p>I believe my very weakness is that sometimes I am easy to give up on something like an idea I thought up to be great. When I suddenly have a hard time doing it I end up procrastinating and in the end wont progress at all. But I still aim to change that and become a better person for the future.</p>

Then once I have the proper experience of a developer I will update my portfolio with works I cannot imagine in order to convince the company that I would apply in that I have the skills and determination of becoming a genuine GameDev.</p>
